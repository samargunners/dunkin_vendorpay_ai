# 🏢 Professional Team Coordination Examples

## 📋 **Real-World Task Coordination Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Document Processing Feature Development**

#### **Week 4 - Sprint 3: Document Processing Foundation**

**Monday Morning - Sprint Planning Meeting**

**Product Manager** presents user story:
```
As a finance manager, I want to upload bank statements 
so that transactions are automatically extracted and available for reconciliation.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Support PDF and CSV uploads up to 50MB
- Extract transaction data with 95% accuracy
- Process within 2 minutes for typical statements
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback
```

**Task Breakdown Session:**

**Tech Lead** breaks down architecture:
```
1. File upload API endpoint
2. File validation and storage
3. OCR processing pipeline
4. Transaction extraction logic
5. Error handling and status tracking
```

**Team Task Assignment:**

| **Backend Engineer 1** | **Backend Engineer 2** | **AI/ML Engineer** | **Frontend Engineer 1** |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| File upload API | Document metadata API | OCR pipeline setup | Upload UI component |
| File validation | Processing status endpoints | Text extraction | Progress indicators |
| Storage integration | Error handling | Data parsing algorithms | File preview |

**Dependencies Identified:**
- Frontend needs API contract from Backend
- AI/ML needs file storage path from Backend
- Backend needs processing results format from AI/ML

---

### **Scenario 2: Cross-Team Dependency Resolution**

#### **Tuesday - Daily Standup Blocker Discussion**

**Frontend Engineer 1**: *"I'm blocked on the upload UI because I need the API contract for file upload."*

**Backend Engineer 1**: *"I can provide a draft API spec by noon today. Let me show you the planned endpoints..."*

**Immediate Action Plan:**
1. **Backend Engineer 1** creates API specification document
2. **Frontend Engineer 1** starts with mock data based on spec
3. **Tech Lead** reviews API design for consistency
4. Integration testing scheduled for Thursday

**Slack Conversation:**
```
Frontend-Backend Channel
11:30 AM - Backend_Dev1: @Frontend_Dev1 API spec ready for review:
POST /api/documents/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Response: {document_id, status, processing_queue_position}

11:35 AM - Frontend_Dev1: Perfect! Can you add file size validation details?

11:37 AM - Backend_Dev1: Added. Max 50MB, supported types: pdf,csv,jpg,png

11:40 AM - Tech_Lead: Looks good. @QA_Engineer please add this to test cases
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Feature Integration Coordination**

#### **Wednesday - Mid-Sprint Check-in**

**Progress Review:**
- **Backend Engineer 1**: Upload API 80% complete, testing with Postman
- **Frontend Engineer 1**: UI component 70% complete, needs API integration
- **AI/ML Engineer**: OCR pipeline 60% complete, accuracy testing in progress

**Integration Planning Meeting (30 minutes):**

**Tech Lead** coordinates integration:
```
Integration Plan:
1. Backend deploys API to dev environment by Thursday 2PM
2. Frontend integrates with dev API Thursday 3PM
3. AI/ML deploys processing pipeline to dev Friday 10AM
4. End-to-end testing Friday afternoon
5. Demo preparation Friday 5PM
```

**Risk Identification:**
- **Risk**: OCR accuracy might not meet 95% target
- **Mitigation**: Prepare fallback to manual review workflow
- **Owner**: AI/ML Engineer with Product Manager backup plan

---

### **Scenario 4: Code Review & Quality Assurance**

#### **Thursday - Code Review Process**

**Pull Request Flow:**

**Backend Engineer 1** submits PR:
```
Title: "Add document upload API with validation"
Description: 
- Implements file upload with size/type validation
- Adds Supabase storage integration
- Includes error handling for invalid files
- Unit tests for validation logic

Reviewers: @Tech_Lead @Backend_Engineer_2
QA: @QA_Engineer for integration testing
```

**Review Comments:**
```
Tech_Lead: "Good implementation. Consider adding rate limiting for large files."
Backend_Engineer_2: "LGTM. Minor: use constants for file size limits."
Security_Review: "Ensure file content validation, not just extension."
```

**QA Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Upload valid PDF files
- [ ] Upload invalid file types
- [ ] Test file size limits
- [ ] Test malformed files
- [ ] Test concurrent uploads
- [ ] Test error message clarity

---

### **Scenario 5: Performance Issue Resolution**

#### **Friday - Performance Bottleneck Discovery**

**QA Engineer** reports issue:
```
Performance Issue Report:
- File upload taking 45 seconds for 10MB PDF
- Target: Under 10 seconds
- Reproducible: Yes, all large PDFs
- Environment: Dev server
```

**Emergency Coordination Session:**

**DevOps Engineer** checks infrastructure:
```
Infrastructure Analysis:
- Server CPU: 15% usage
- Memory: 40% usage
- Network: Bottleneck identified - single-threaded upload
- Storage: Write speed normal
```

**Solution Brainstorming:**
- **Backend Engineer 1**: "We can implement chunked uploads"
- **DevOps Engineer**: "Or increase server bandwidth allocation"
- **Tech Lead**: "Let's try chunked uploads first - less infrastructure cost"

**Action Plan:**
1. **Backend Engineer 1**: Implement chunked upload (4 hours)
2. **Frontend Engineer 1**: Update UI for chunked progress (2 hours)
3. **QA Engineer**: Re-test performance (1 hour)
4. **DevOps Engineer**: Monitor server metrics during testing
