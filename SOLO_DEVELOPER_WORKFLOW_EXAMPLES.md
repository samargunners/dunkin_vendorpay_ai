# Solo Developer Daily Workflow Examples

## Real-World Solo Development Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Monday Morning - Weekly Planning Session

**Time**: 9:00 AM Monday
**Duration**: 60 minutes
**Goal**: Plan the week's work and review progress

```markdown
# Monday Planning Session Example

## Previous Week Review (15 minutes)
‚úÖ Completed: Document upload API endpoint

Priority 3: Start basic dashboard UI
Priority 4: Fix authentication middleware

## Daily Breakdown (20 minutes)
Monday: Finish OCR integration, fix Tesseract setup
Tuesday: Transaction API endpoints (create, read)
Wednesday: Transaction API endpoints (update, delete)
Thursday: Start React dashboard setup
Friday: Authentication fixes and testing

## Learning Goals (5 minutes)
- Research better OCR alternatives (EasyOCR)
- Learn React Query for API state management
- Study FastAPI authentication best practices
```

### Scenario 2: Wednesday Afternoon - Debugging Session

**Time**: 2:30 PM Wednesday
**Context**: Transaction API returning 500 errors
**Approach**: Systematic debugging as a solo developer

```python
# Solo Developer Debugging Process

# 1. First, check the logs
def debug_transaction_issue():
    """
    Solo developer debugging checklist:
    1. Check application logs
    2. Test API endpoint directly
    3. Verify database connection
    4. Check data validation
    5. Review recent code changes
    """
    
    # Check logs first
    print("üîç Checking application logs...")
    
    # Test endpoint isolation
    print("üß™ Testing API endpoint directly...")
    
    # Database verification
    print("üóÉÔ∏è Verifying database connection...")
    
    # Talk through the problem (rubber duck debugging)
    print("ü¶Ü Talking through the issue:")
    print("- API was working yesterday")
    print("- Error started after adding transaction validation")
    print("- 500 error suggests server-side issue")
    print("- Need to check validation logic")

# 2. Self-code review process
def solo_code_review():
    """
    When you're your own reviewer, be extra critical
    """
    checklist = [
        "Is error handling comprehensive?",
        "Are all edge cases covered?",
        "Is the code readable for future me?",
        "Are there any potential security issues?",
        "Is the logic too complex?",
        "Are tests covering this functionality?"
    ]
    
    for question in checklist:
        print(f"‚úì {question}")

# 3. Document the solution
solution_notes = """
ISSUE: Transaction API 500 error
CAUSE: ValidationError not being caught properly in transaction creation
SOLUTION: Added try-except block around Pydantic validation
TIME TO RESOLVE: 45 minutes
PREVENTION: Add validation error handling to checklist
"""
```

### Scenario 3: Friday Evening - Weekly Deployment

**Time**: 4:00 PM Friday
**Goal**: Deploy week's work to staging environment

```bash
# Solo Developer Deployment Checklist

echo "üöÄ Friday Deployment Process"

# 1. Pre-deployment checks
echo "üìã Pre-deployment checklist:"
echo "‚úì All tests passing locally"
echo "‚úì Code formatted and linted"
echo "‚úì Documentation updated"
echo "‚úì No console.logs or print statements"
echo "‚úì Environment variables documented"

# 2. Self-testing process
echo "üß™ Self-testing the features:"
echo "- Test document upload manually"
echo "- Verify transaction CRUD operations"
echo "- Check API documentation is accurate"
echo "- Test error scenarios"

# 3. Deployment steps
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/transaction-api
git push origin main

# 4. Monitor deployment
echo "üëÄ Monitoring deployment:"
echo "- Check application logs for errors"
echo "- Verify all endpoints responding"
echo "- Test critical user flows"
echo "- Document any issues for Monday"

# 5. Weekly reflection
echo "üìù Weekly reflection notes:"
echo "What went well: Transaction API completed ahead of schedule"
echo "What to improve: Need better error handling patterns"
echo "Next week focus: Dashboard UI development"
```

## Solo Developer Problem-Solving Strategies

### When Stuck on Technical Issues

```markdown
# The Solo Developer's Problem-Solving Framework

## Level 1: Quick Fixes (15 minutes)
1. Check error messages carefully
2. Review recent changes in git diff
3. Restart development server
4. Clear cache/node_modules
5. Check environment variables

## Level 2: Research & Documentation (30 minutes)
1. Search Stack Overflow for exact error
2. Check official documentation
3. Look for GitHub issues in relevant repos
4. Review similar code in the project
5. Check if it's a known issue

## Level 3: Deep Dive Investigation (60+ minutes)
1. Create minimal reproduction case
2. Step through code with debugger
3. Add extensive logging
4. Test each component in isolation
5. Review architecture decisions

## Level 4: Ask for Help (When all else fails)
1. Post detailed question on Stack Overflow
2. Ask in relevant Discord/Slack communities
3. Open GitHub issue if it's a library bug
4. Consider pair programming with friend/mentor
5. Schedule call with technical advisor
```

### Solo Developer Decision Making

# ADR: State Management for VendorPay AI

## Status: Accepted

## Context
As a solo developer, I need to choose a state management solution that:
- I can understand and maintain alone
- Has good learning resources
- Won't become a burden as the app grows

## Decision
Using React Query + useState for state management

## Consequences
Positive:
- Simple to understand and debug
- Minimal boilerplate
- Great for server state management

Negative:
- May need refactoring for complex client state
- Less structured than Redux

## Review Date
Review this decision in 3 months (January 2026)

## Solo Developer Learning Strategy

### Continuous Learning While Building

```markdown
# Learning While Building Strategy

## Just-In-Time Learning
- Learn only what you need for current sprint
- Deep dive when you hit a blocker
- Don't learn technologies "just in case"

## Documentation-Driven Learning
- Write documentation as you learn
- Create personal knowledge base
- Build examples for future reference

## Code Review with Future Self
```

```python
# Self-Code Review Process
def self_code_review_checklist():
    """
    Comprehensive checklist for solo developers
    """
    checklist = {
        'readability': [
            'Will I understand this code in 6 months?',
            'Are variable names descriptive?',
            'Is the logic flow clear?',
            'Are complex parts commented?'
        ],
        'maintainability': [
            'Is this code DRY (Don\'t Repeat Yourself)?',
            'Are functions/classes single-purpose?',
            'Is error handling comprehensive?',
            'Are there potential edge cases?'
        ],
        'testing': [
            'Are critical paths tested?',
            'Do tests cover error scenarios?',
            'Are integration points tested?',
            'Is test data realistic?'
