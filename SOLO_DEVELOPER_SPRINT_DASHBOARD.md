## Problem Tracking

### Current Blockers
```
🚫 BLOCKER: Supabase environment variables not configured
   Impact: Cannot test database operations
   Action: Configure .env file with Supabase credentials
   ETA: Tuesday 10/19

⚠️  ISSUE: FastAPI app fails to start
   Impact: Cannot run development server
   Action: Fix import errors in ai_models package
   ETA: Today

📝 TODO: Set up automated testing
   Impact: Manual testing only currently
   Action: Configure pytest and GitHub Actions
   ETA: Wednesday 10/20
```

### Risk Assessment
```
🔴 HIGH RISK: Solo developer burnout
   Mitigation: Maintain 40h/week limit, take weekends off

🟡 MEDIUM RISK: Technical complexity overwhelming
   Mitigation: Break features into smaller chunks, learn incrementally

🟢 LOW RISK: Scope creep
   Mitigation: Stick to MVP features, document future enhancements
```
